Project Five of the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree course work via Treehouse

I'm going for exceeds expectations in all categories

- Employees can be filtered by name in the search box, simply start typing
- The modal box's prev and next buttons function as intended(switching back and forth between employees), even when you have filtered employees via search
- Multiple style adjustments have been made
  - Each retrieved "employee" has a color defined for them based on their birthday
  - This color follows the last selected employee around (modal colors and page background)
  - Animations for next, previous, and close modal options have been defined 
  - While the modal is open the gallery is lightly blurred
